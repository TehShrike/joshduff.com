During my last semesters at such an institution, I took part in an end-of-year celebratory tradition involving a ridiculous sandwich.</p>
<p>In some issue of Maxim (November 2005?) there was an article featuring absurd sandwich-based foods.  So ridiculous were these edibles that some fraternity brothers of mine decided that the consumption of one such sandwich would make a fitting end-of-semester celebration.</p>
<p>I was unable to find the original article online, but found the ingredients <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101103053652/http://www.ntxalliance.com/index.php?action=printpage;topic=3970.0">here</a>.  I post them here for posterity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Use two slices of buttery Texas toast as bookends, and slap together a sausage patty, hash browns, and three generous chops of ham, separating each layer with a slice of cheddar cheese. Throw two fried eggs in the mix, and comfort them with four strips of crispy bacon. A splash of ketchup or Worcestershire sauce is your choice, but tons of S&amp;P is mandatory."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would usually go to IHOP, order the ingredients individually, and assemble the sandwiches ourselves.  The braver souls in the group would purchase fries as a side dish.</p>
<p>These memories are making me hungry.</p>
