title: Podcasts that excellent for specific reasons

I've been listening to podcasts for a few years now - they're pretty great, and I listen to a lot of popular ones that are known for being great.  That's not interesting.

hile listening to these podcasts-of-established-quality, I've caught on to a lot of the standards or tropes that well-produced podcasts adhere to.  Good audio quality, interesting personalities, whatever.  That's not interesting either.

What is potentially interesting is that there are a few podcasts that aim high and kick an unusual amount of ass in areas that most casters don't.  They're so good at it that it can be easy to miss, so I wanted to call out a few.

# [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/): ad reads

Wait, don't go!  I'm serious!

Most long-term podcasts do ad reads during the episode.  I've become a connoiseur of ad reads for Casper mattresses and Harrys razors.

Good hosts will try to sell only things they are willing to put their reputation behind, will attempt to deliver the ad in their unique voice, and avoid fast mechanical-sounding reads.

CGP Grey and Brady do better - every single ad read is from a custom one-off script, written by the host doing the read.  They do hit up the points given by the marketers, but they always have an anecdote or observation to build each ad read around.

It's easy for the ads to all blend together when the same advertiser is buying a spot for the tenth week in a row.  CGP Grey and Brady are consistently professional and if I were advertising something they would get my money happily.

# [ATP](http://atp.fm/): letting each other talk

In everyday boisterous conversations when multiple people have something to say, "who gets to say the next thing" usually comes down to a combination of charisma + how badly the person wants to force their thought into the stream.  It's an everyday communication problem.

Unscripted shows with multiple hosts deal with their own version.  Even if you can't see the body language, you can usually still hear the audio cues, people beginning a sentence while someone else is still talking, or interjecting at various flex points in a sentence.

The three hosts of the Accidental Tech Podcast are all opinionated, with plenty of opinions to deliver, but they feel like they're at another level of communication.

Listening to them makes me realize how bad I am at talking.

In the course of a discussion, they will often hold forth in long monologues - even to twenty minutes or more - speaking clearly and thoughtfully, and without any interruptions from cohosts.

I fail on both counts - I couldn't speak clearly and thoughtfully for twenty minutes, and I certainly don't go that long without interrupting.  ATP makes me want to aim higher.

I suspect they have some out-of-band communication or deal with lots of accidental simultaneous-starts in editing, because when one finishes speaking, one of the other two cohosts always speaks up with a response that could turn into a similar monologue.

Or maybe they're just really, really good at verbal conversations.  Either way, I'm consistently impressed.

# [We Hate Movies](http://www.whmpodcast.com/): rambling without getting lost

Boisterous podcasts have to deal with the same issue as drunken conversations: if someone starts rambling, you're probably off on a ten-minute rabbit trail and nobody will remember exactly what you were talking about originally when you get to the end of the trail.

If you value your listening time, podcasts with ramble-capable hosts are good choices for unsubscription.

While most good podcasts take the sensible route and avoid rambling diversions, the WHM hosts double down to master the side joke.  They do improve comedy among other tawdry things, and are not afraid to riff on a thread for a while.

Their excellence is a function of their ability to keep from being derailed for too long of a stretch - they seem to have pretty good internal timers ticking down to when a joke would go on long enough to the point of making the podcast less funny as a whole.

Beyond that, Andrew is a fantastic MC, quickly bringing the topic back to the next plot point in the movie when a joke has run its course.

These aren't necessarily my three favorite podcasts, but they are all uniquely excellent in a way I appreciate.
